# Compiler

Created a Pascal compiler

- The **`.l`** file is the file that will generate the tokens of identification for the semantic/syntactic analyzer to process. 

- The **`.y`** is the descirbed semantic/syntactic analyzer as mentioned above, where it gets a token and interpret them based on the rules defined by the compiler.
